## UwU Whats Dis?
Some time ago I decided, that it would be great if my old car could detect streetsigns. So I tried to cobble a thing together, that somehow works.
I use OpenCV for image recognition and rely on pattern matching for the first try. Maybe I will be switching to neural networks in the future (Big maybe atm.)
I talked about this in a presentation at Kassel IT-Sec Meetup a while ago, you can find the slides here (TODO: Add link).
Recently I got some time to sort things out an hope that I can focus on this Project more.

I will first try to do a code cleanup and write this whole thing object oriented. 
### Repo
In the main branch there will be (Until I get all things sorted) the original Script (Sadly without demo videos etc., since this would be a nightmare in terms of GDPR)
There will be a branch OOP, in which I will put the new code.

## Hardware
Currently an old Hitachi BW CCD Highspeed shutter camera, which is typically used in sorting maschines and industrial applications, for the camera part. Since i only got an analog signal, I use a cheap capture card to gather the footage.
